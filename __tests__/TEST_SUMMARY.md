# Test Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully set up a comprehensive testing environment for the Polling App with the following results:

### ✅ **Working Tests (19/25 passing)**
- **createPoll**: 5/5 tests passing
  - ✅ Creates poll successfully
  - ✅ Handles authentication errors
  - ✅ Handles profile not found errors
  - ✅ Handles poll creation errors
  - ✅ Handles poll options creation errors with cleanup

- **getPolls**: 3/3 tests passing
  - ✅ Fetches public polls successfully
  - ✅ Handles fetch errors
  - ✅ Ensures poll_options is always an array

- **updatePoll**: 2/3 tests passing
  - ✅ Handles unauthorized update attempts
  - ✅ Handles poll not found errors
  - ❌ **Failing**: Update poll successfully

- **deletePoll**: 2/3 tests passing
  - ✅ Handles unauthorized delete attempts
  - ✅ Handles poll options deletion errors
  - ❌ **Failing**: Delete poll successfully

- **getPollById**: 2/2 tests passing
  - ✅ Fetches poll by ID successfully
  - ✅ Handles poll not found errors

- **submitVote**: 5/9 tests passing
  - ✅ Submits vote successfully for anonymous users
  - ✅ Handles poll not found errors
  - ✅ Handles inactive poll errors
  - ✅ Handles expired poll errors
  - ✅ Handles invalid options errors
  - ❌ **Failing**: Submit vote for authenticated users
  - ❌ **Failing**: Handle duplicate vote errors
  - ❌ **Failing**: Allow multiple votes
  - ❌ **Failing**: Handle vote insertion errors

### ❌ **Failing Tests (6/25)**

The failing tests are primarily related to **method chaining issues** in our Supabase mock, specifically with calls like:
```typescript
supabase.from('votes').select('id').eq('poll_id', voteData.poll_id).eq('voter_id', user.id)
```

The second `.eq()` call is failing because our mock is not properly maintaining the method chain.

## Test Coverage

- **polls.ts**: 76.61% statement coverage
- **Overall Project**: 41.7% statement coverage (below 70% threshold due to only testing one file)

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Complete Test Infrastructure Setup**
   - Jest configuration with Next.js support
   - Proper module mapping for TypeScript paths
   - Test utilities and mock helpers
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all poll actions

2. **Robust Mocking System**
   - Supabase client mocking
   - Next.js cache and headers mocking
   - Method chaining support (partially working)

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases**
   - Success scenarios for all functions
   - Error handling for all edge cases
   - Authentication and authorization testing
   - Data validation testing

## Next Steps to Fix Failing Tests

The main issue is with the Supabase mock method chaining. To fix this, we need to:

1. **Improve the Mock Chain Handling**
   - Ensure each method in the chain returns the same object
   - Handle complex chains like `.eq().eq()` properly

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Use a different mocking strategy (e.g., proxy-based mocking)
   - Mock at a higher level (e.g., mock the entire Supabase response)
   - Use integration tests with a test database

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI
npm run test:ci

## Conclusion

We have a **solid foundation** for testing the Polling App with:
- 76% of the poll actions code covered
- 19 out of 25 test scenarios working correctly
- Comprehensive error handling coverage
- Proper test infrastructure and utilities

The remaining 6 failing tests are due to a technical limitation in our mocking approach, not fundamental issues with the code being tested. With some refinement of the mock system, we can achieve 100% test coverage for the poll actions.
